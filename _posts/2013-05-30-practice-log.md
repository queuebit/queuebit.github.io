* [Intro to 'Write Code Faster: Expert-level Vim'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke7SfUFvvxo)
	1. Learn to use the vim `:help`
	2. Keep a cheat sheet on your desk (7-10 commands), find excuses to use them

		* If you do something the _wrong_ way, undo it and redo it the _right_ way
	3. Keep track of your annoyances (mistakes, things that are harder than they should be, etc) and put them on a list (back of cheat sheet)
	4. Learn all of the single letter commands (80% of power with 20% of effort - Pareto)
	5. Rebind caps lock to ESC

title: When life gives you discoveryd crashes...

Today _(yesterday as I write this)_ was a day of setbacks.

In planning for today, I knew I wasn't going to be able to make progress on my primary project, because I needed to travel and pickup some stuff I bought online. I like what I bought, but I need to do a better job of determining the [implicit opportunity cost] of spending personal time to "save money" when I could be creating value through pushing work products forward (my time isn't _"free"_).

[implicit opportunity cost]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost#Implicit_costs

That opportunity cost was further compounded as the [Mac mini][mm] I have hosted with [Macminicolo][mmc] crashed three times over the past two days and I wasn't able to spend the day investigating the crash. In working tonight I seem to be have tracked it down to an issue with `discoveryd_helper` but as of yet, [I haven't found the fix][ddh].

On the bright side, driving gives me an opportunity to think through possibilities and work through some other programming problems, but the "work work" is left for _tomorrow_.

Now, it is time for ðŸ˜´.

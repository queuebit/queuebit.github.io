[Nathan Kontny](https://twitter.com/natekontny) has gotten back into daily vlogging, and I am stealing a lot from his shared tech-dad experiences in these _novel_ times.

A lot of times we get lost in the "what is the best equipment/tool/thing to do `_____`?" and we forget about the **start** part.

Back in the day, I often suffered from [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) when thinking about what I should buy to solve a problem/need in my life. Luckily, today we have [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter). Now, I just search Wirecutter and pick between one of the options when I need to buy a new gadget for the kitchen/house.

That's great when we have a need, but most of the time we already have all the right tools we just need to **start** be it YouTube, Blogging, Reading, etc.

It's been a couple months, but today I am going to get back to working through [100 Days of HackingWithSwift UI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

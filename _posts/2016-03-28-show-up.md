I have really been enjoying following many who are on a journey of daily production of *something* that is at the core of their expertise.

It started with John Saddington starting [a daily vlog][js] on January 1. His effort only lasted ten days, but it inspired me. More recently I have been enjoying [WheezyWaiter][ww] and his whiteboard continueing to hone his craft and himself. Wheezy "copied" the style of [Casey Neistat][cn], who I just found as well.

I have been busy working on a number of really fun projects that just three months ago were never even on the radar, but I feel like the best way for me to keep growing and creating great things is by practicing on the core of my skills and producing *something*.

The most recent inspiration for this is Potatowire's [with the grain][wtg] series and Manton Reece's trips in his Nissan Leaf to [coffee shops][cs] and [libraries][l].

I am going to start writing and creating mini data vizualizations, not necessarily daily, but regularly (to be defined later).

Thanks for inspiring, and hopefully I can create some cool stuff in the process.

I finally got around to trading in old Apple gear via <https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in>.

I am planning to upgrade to a laser printer and pick up a new [M1 MBA](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) that Marco Arment has been raving about on [ATP](https://atp.fm/).

_Migrated from <https://micro.queuebit.net/apple-trade-in/>._

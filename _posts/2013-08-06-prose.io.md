I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages) to create this blog. 

I was really inspired by [an episode of The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead/54) to build a static site for my blog rather than going with something like Tumblr or Wordpress. [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/) built some great websites (see the shownotes from The Web Ahead for a subset of them) with Jekyll and created many tools to aid the workflow. 

One of those tools they built was [Prose.io](http://prose.io/#about), _"Prose provides a beatifully simple content authoring environment for CMS-free websites."_ By providing Prose access to your GitHub repos you can you Prose to create and edit posts in a browser anywhere. Prose handles the commits with GitHub.

Here is what this post looks like within Prose:

Later this fall I am going to be rebuilding a website for a small startup. The site will consist of marketing pages and a blog. Jekyll will be able to handle both and Prose.io will enable others to create and manage the site.

Thanks to Development Seed for creating a great tool!

I ran into some errors with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) trying to install [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) (a potential [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) replacement) on Wednesday. One of the troubleshooting steps included uninstalling [macports](http://guide.macports.org/).  It wasn't until after I saw some of the items macports was deleting that I noticed it would be dropping some of [nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/)'s dependencies.

After the macports uninstall was complete, I was able to confirm the same by running the tests for my side project.

> TESTS FAIL!

Luckily I used [bundler](http://bundler.io/) when building [a simple Sinatra/Active Record app](https://github.com/queuebit/nai.warikan) last week.

### Steps to make tests pass again
1. Create a Gemfile for the project 
2. `bundle install`
3. `rake test` 
  > TESTS PASS!
4. `git add Gemfile`
5. `git commit -m "Thanks Bundler!"`

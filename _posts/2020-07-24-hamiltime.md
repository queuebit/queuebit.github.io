With [Hamilton](https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/hamilton/3uPmBHWlO6HJ) now out on [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/), I can see and listen to any song I want at any time.

**Except**, there is no chapter support on Disney+ to be able to jump to a certain song...

_ENTER_ [Hamiltime](https://github.com/queuebit/hamiltime):
> A simple Chrome Extension that lets you jump to any song in Act I or Act II, whenever you want.

Give it a try, and let me know if/how I can improve it.

It has been a while since I have posted, and it seems like the Netlify build is failing for this microblog.

```
9:20:54 AM: Build ready to start
9:20:54 AM: ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  UNSUPPORTED BUILD IMAGE

  The build image for this site uses Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, which is no longer supported.

  To enable builds for this site, select a later build image at the following link:
  https://app.netlify.com/sites/brave-ardinghelli-70d541/settings/deploys#build-image-selection

  For more details, visit the build image migration guide:
  https://answers.netlify.com/t/end-of-support-for-trusty-build-image-everything-you-need-to-know/39004
```

I followed the blog post and updated my build image to `Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (default)`. Time to retry.

----

Build failed.

```
9:29:49 AM: error type-fest@2.10.0: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=12.20". Got "10.24.1"
9:29:49 AM: error Found incompatible module.

9:29:49 AM: Error during Yarn install
9:29:49 AM: Build was terminated: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 1
```

I am not going to try to `Clear cache and deploy site`, in case it was caching a node module from `trusty`.

Build failed.

- `npm run dev` - works locally on macOS 12.1 -- serving content at `http://localhost:8000/`
- same with other `npm run` commands from package.json

The [blog post](https://answers.netlify.com/t/please-read-end-of-support-for-trusty-build-image-everything-you-need-to-know/39004#how-can-i-make-my-site-work-with-the-new-image-6) does a good job of describing the issues that I am running into with the new build image. Specifically I am running into issues with `yarn 1.17`. I am not sure why it is trying to install that when the default should be `yarn 1.22` per the [docs](https://github.com/netlify/build-image/blob/focal/included_software.md#tools). I am going to set it to `yarn 1.22` and rebuild.

I am going to specify the node version in `package.json` per [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29349773/1217). Push up code and retry build.

Build failed.

I am going to hardcode `NODE_VERSION` in environment variables to 12 and retry.

Time to take a break and try and see how to get it working locally with latest / greatest versions rather than relying on fixing things one-by-one from 2020.

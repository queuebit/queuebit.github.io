I spent a couple hours this afternoon getting started with [D3.js][d3].

[d3]: https://d3js.org/

I worked my way through [@mbostock][mbo]'s [block] and [bar chart][bar] tutorials. After completing each, I have much greater grasp on the svg elements and building some simple charts with D3.

[block]: https://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/
[bar]: https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/

All of the d3 blocks that I will be working on publicly will be available at <http://bl.ocks.org/queuebit> (although the bar chart block seems to be having some sort of caching issue at the moment).

Tomorrow, I plan on working on adding limited interactivity and working my way through [three little circles][circles] and [towards reusable charts][reusable].

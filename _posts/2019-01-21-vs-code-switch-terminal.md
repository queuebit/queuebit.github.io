I have been wanting to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) more and more, but I keep finding it frustration to switch between the editor and terminal while using a mouse.

My normal _modus operandi_ is using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) with three panes: 
1. [vim](https://www.vim.org/) editor
2. terminal 1
3. terminal 2

I have a similar setup in VS Code, but having to use the mouse to jump between the editor to terminal resulted in nothing but frustrations.

I finally took the initiative to Google for a solution and found a solution via Stack Overflow, to [overload a single key binding with a where clause](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43012779/1217).

Thanks, [wgj](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2529592/wgj)!

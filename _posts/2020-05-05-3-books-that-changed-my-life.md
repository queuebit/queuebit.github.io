I have enjoyed finding a new YouTuber that seems to heavily overlap with the odd venn diagram that is my interests as well.

* Apple
* Technology
* GTD
* Medicine

Slowing working through some of his back catalog via _"the YouTube algorithm"_ in the sidebar.

His book recommendations:

* _The 4-Hour Workweek_ by Tim Ferriss
  * I don't always think about things the same way that Tim does, but his approaches always helps me to challenge my own thinking and processing. I continue to read his books / podcasts.
* _Show Your Work_ by Austin Kleon
  * This is a more recent book for me, but it is really impactful and super quick.
  * This micro.blog is one way I have gone about starting to share what I am working on.
  * If you feel imposter syndrome preventing you from sharing, because you aren't an expert, remember there is always someone earlier in their journey than you are.
* _Anything you Want_ by Derek Sivers
  * Derek's writing style is such an easy read; it inspires me to action.
  * His [book reviews](https://sivers.org/book) are always a great initial resource as well, similar to Blinkist.

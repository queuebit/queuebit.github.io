A mashup of [Iâ€™m a boring programmer (and proud of it)][boring] and [_"Here's to the Crazy Ones"_][crazy]:

> <em>Here's to the boring ones: <br />
> The librarians, <br />
> The scientists, <br />
> The ones who plan, but work with what they've got.</em>
>
> <em>While some may see them as the "boring" ones, <br />
> We appreciate **you**.</em>
>
> <em>Because the people who are boring enough to craft things one line at a time, <br />
> are the ones that do.</em>
>    
> <em>`Think boring.` </em>

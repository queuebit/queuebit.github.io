Tonight, I was going down a rabbit hole sharing fun links of things to buy on the internet to a friend.

It became apparent that it had become "too much." So rather than sending unsolicited links, I thought I should let people opt in, and I should become an influencer so I could get a tiny bit of money off of sharing cool links of things I found on the internet.

Quite a few years ago, I had the capitalistic idea, similar to that of woot.com / meh.com of sharing expensive "junk" that people probably shouldn't buy online, but if they did buy it, I most definitely wanted to make a commission on it. A friend and I went halvsies on the domain, set up an Amazon affiliate account, and posted a few very expensive items. We kept the site up for a year and then shut it down when the affiliate commission couldn't pay for the domain name renewal. The domain name we had used was ~~redacted~~. I really liked the name, and might bring it back after I can raise a pre-angel round to afford it.

In 2022, I am going to try and innovate by creating a newsletter, with an RSS feed and links to cool stuff. Some will have affliate links, some won't. I'll will only put stuff in the newsletter if I like it or if people pay me to put it there, but I will at least dislose the reason I put it there. And that is because the FTC told me I have to.

I was hoping to start this newsletter tonight and leave a link to sign up here, but I need a physical address to sign up for a newsletter, and I don't want to go out there and dox myself at this point in the process, so I need to figure out a way to handle that first.

In the mean time, go play a Wordle-esque game, and I will update again when I have a newsletter.

Some of my current favorites:
- Worldle - so hard to spell / say - <https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/> - if you like geography
- morsle - <https://morsle.fun/> - if you think that morse code shouldn't be *that* hard
- Semantle - <https://semantle.novalis.org/> - if you think that Silas had some good ideas in _The Da Vinci Code_

`:peace:`

## What I am doing now

I'm living in Indiana, with my wife and two daughters.

I am working on the following (_in order of time spent_):

* Being a good husband and father
* Adding D3.js visualizations to web app prototype
* Learning about React.js and building the skeleton around the visualizations
* Adding infrastructure to support client deployments using Heroku, AWS, and Digital Ocean
* Supporting client delivery process for existing application

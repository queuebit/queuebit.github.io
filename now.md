## What I am doing now

I'm living in Indiana, with my wife and two daughters.

I am working on the following (_in order of time spent_):

* Being a good husband and father
* Working to be a better software engineering manager through [reading](https://www.manager-tools.com/products/effective-manager-book), [listening](https://www.audible.com/pd/Managing-Humans-Audiobook/B08966SX9M), and [learning](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/typescript-basics).
* Solving elf puzzles via [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/).
* Learning about marketing and selling from [Lex Friedman](https://lexfriedman.substack.com/).
* [Re-learning](https://queuebit.net/blog/2013/05/22/getting-started-with-deliberate-practice.html) about how [Follow Your Passion is Terrible Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE-wvWdM6jY&list=WL&index=1&t=36s).
* [Reminiscing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reminisce) on [Ira Glass's tips on Storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ezU57J8YI&list=PLuIu7YRdU32NIr2DysU3kxqnvs_flQyvs&ab_channel=AliceMaravilhaNeo).

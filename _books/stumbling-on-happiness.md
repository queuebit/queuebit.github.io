## _Stumbling on Happiness_ by Daniel Gilbert

After reading _[The Elements of Style][eos]_ yesterday, this book is at the other end of the spectrum. Instead of just telling me the gist of what I need to know, Daniel goes in depth describing the research and psychology that create a structure around what we *just* refer to as **Happiness**.

I am sure the research is insightful, but it isn't what I am looking for. The bones and structure of the book helped me to better understand and look at _happiness_ but I don't need to know the details. Having just finished Season 2 of [Invisibilia][invis], I appreciated the way Lulu, Alix, and Hanna constructed the information and research into _stories_.

Daniel opens each chapter with a quote from Shapespeare; if _that's_ your jam, then this book is for you.

Derek Sivers, who should always be trusted more than me, gave the book a [10/10][10].

#### my notes

* PART I - Prospection

    >> The act of looking forward in time or considering the future.

    > ...the human brain's greatest achievement...conscious experience.

    > In Part II, "Subjectivity," I will tell you about the science of happiness.

    > In Part III, "Realism," I will tell you about the first shortcoming: Imagination works so quickly, quietly, and effectively that we are insufficiently skeptical of its products.

    > In Part IV, "Presentism," I will tell you about the second shortcoming: Imagination's products are ... well, not particularly imaginative, which is why the imagined future often looks so much like the actual present.

    > In Part V, "Rationalization," ...If we have trouble foreseeing future events, then we have even more trouble foreseeing how we will see them when they happen.

    > ...in Part VI, "Corrigibility," I will tell you why illusions of foresight are note easily remedied by personal experience or by the wisdom we inherit from our grandmothers.

    > ...I hope you will understand why most of us spend so much of our lives turning rudders and hoisting sails, only to find that Shangri-la isn't what and where we thought it would be.

* PART II - Subjectivity

    >> The fact that experience is unobservable to everyone but the person having it.

* PART III - Realism

    >> The belief that things are in reality as they appear to be in the mind.

    > Even though we are aware in some vaguely academic sense that our brains are doing the filling-in trick, we can't help but expect the future to unfold with the details we imagine.

* PART IV - Presentism

    >> The tendency for current experience to influence one's views of the past and the future.

* PART V - Rationalization

    >> The act of causing something to be or to seem reasonable.

    >> For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
    >>
    >> &mdash; Shakespear, Hamlet Prince of Denmark

* PART VI - Corrigibility

    >> Ability to be being corrected, reformed, or improved

* Afterword

    > Most of us make at least three important decisions in our lives; where to live, what to do, and with whom to do it...Making these decisions is such a natural part of adulthood that it is easy to forget that we are among the first human beings to make them.

    > How are we to make these choices?

    > Daniel Bernoulli claimed...that the wisdom of any decision could be calculated by multiplying the **probability**  that the decision will give us what we want by the **utility** of getting what we want.
